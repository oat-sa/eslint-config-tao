# eslint-config-tao

Shareable `.eslintrc` configurations package for `oat-sa` projects.

## Concept

All extensions, projects and libraries under (`oat-sa` wide) should use the shared config as a basis.
Current extension contains a pack of shareable configs depending on the stack and target.
General idea is described here: [https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs]()
